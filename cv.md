Below you will find a summary of my educational experiences. I list the courses that constitute my Graduate Degree Certificates simply because the range of topics covered among the undergraduate and graduate level course offerings for such programs vary greatly. It is helpful to see the courses I selected based on my interests.

## Stanford University Software Systems Graduate Certificate (2025)

This is a more focused program, especially concerned with networking and operating systems. By completing this program I was able to implement two of the most notorious long-term software engineering projects at Stanford: building the compiler for the COOL programming language and implementing all major components of the PintOS operating system.

- CS143 Compilers
- CS240 Advanced Topics in Operating Systems
- CS212 Operating Systems and Systems Programming
- CS144 Introduction to Computer Networking
- CS103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing

## Stanford University Introductory Programming Graduate Certificate (2023)

I built my foundational knowledge of algorithms and data structures. After gaining an overview of the different paths available to computer scientists after such foundational work, I decided to pursue operating systems research and development.

- CS111 Operating Systems Principles
- CS107 Computer Organization and Systems
- CS106B Programming Abstractions
- CS106L Standard C++ Programming
- CS106A Programming Methodology

## Stanford University Master's in Education (2018)

I gained valuable knowledge in the fields of childhood development, curriculum, and instruction strategies for equity and engagement, and leadership skills applicable to any setting. After this intensive one-year Master's program, I graduated with my preliminary teaching credential in English.

## Kenyon College Bachelor of Arts in English (2017)

While playing NCAA D3 Lacrosse, eventually leading the team as Senior Captain, I completed my English Major. Kenyon College has a rich tradition of literary review and analysis that I was able to explore through my focus on American Literature.

### Lacrosse

I coached the Colombia Men's lacrosse team in Bogot√° during the summer before their 2014 World Lacrosse Men's Championship debut. 

During my time for Kenyon Lacrosse, I received NCAC All-Conference awards including Honorable Mention, Second-Team (2x), and First-Team.
